A basic starter template for several electron based projects I want to work on.

Includes support for:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Webpack, Babel, and everything provided by [electron-webpack](https://webpack.electron.build/)

### Why?

Most electron boilerplates, templates, bootstrapers, etc. were either really outdated or had too little/too many tools installed. All were very hard to reconfigure to my specific needs.
